# Miss Cocktail

Miss Cocktail is a Ruby in Rails web app that stores cocktails recipes and reviews, specially designed for amateur cocktail sommeliers and bartenders.

<!-- ## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
packagemanager install awesome-project
awesome-project start
awesome-project "Do something!"  # prints "Nah."
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above. -->

<!-- ### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements. -->

## Developing

To clone the project locally:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/maiteeguren/rails-mister-cocktail
cd rails-mister-cocktail/
```


<!-- 
### Deploying / Publishing
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does. -->
